# Zillow Clustering Project - What is driving the errors in the Zestimates?

## Goal:
* Improve our original estimate of the log error by using clustering methodologies

# Data:
* From the Zillow data:
    * 2017 properties and prediction data from zillow database for  single unit/single family homes.

# Deliverables:
> Notebook: A final notebook (what you will deliver in your presenation) that is cleaned. It has markdown talking through thought processes, steps taken, decisions made. It has code commented. It runs the functions instead of the code behind it, in the tasks where functions are stored in a separate module. It includes the project planning steps. Be sure you prepare!! It has an intro, agenda, start with a summary of what you found (as you would in slides) and a conclusion. It has visualizations that incorporate best practices and that show your greatest discoveries in your exploration.

> ReadMe: You will need a ReadMe to indicate how to reproduce your work. You can include your project planning steps here as well, if you would like. Or a version of it.

> Modules: Where functions are necessary, indicated or ideal, it runs the functions in the notebook, but the functions are stored in their respective modules (prepare.py, e.g.). You will have an acquire.py, prepare.py (or wrangle to cover both acquire and prepare), and model.py (fit, predict, evaluate the final model). For bonus, you could add a preprocessing.py (where you will split, scale...or split_scale.py) and explore/clustering module, but it is not necessary.

# Executive Summary 

After extensive exploration, these were out findings:

Through statistical testing, we hypothesised that the the key items that could help us predict logerror were:

* Location: The logerror seemed to have different ranges based on the location, particularly between the the diffrent counties. 
* House age: The model seemed to be able to predict home value more accurately in older house.
* Size of the property: The size of the property had a impact on logerror, with smaller houses having more 
* Home quality: The value of logerror was smaller in houses with higher quality

* Features that do show a strong relationship with our target variable, `logerror`: 
    * `calculatedfinishedsquarefeet`
    * `fips`
    * `rawcensusblocktrack`
    * `roomcnt`
    * `taxvaluedollarcnt`
    * `landtaxvaluedollarcnt`
    * `taxamount`
    * `age_home`
    * `value_ratio`

Based on this, and other key insights that we gathered from exploration, we engieneered our own features to help with modeling. 

    * `age_home`: The age of the house in years as of 2017
    * `total_size`: The total size of the property (`lotsizesquarefeet` + `calculatedsquarefeet12`)
    * `value_ratio`: That is the rate between home tax and property tax
    * `tax_rate`: The `tax amount` / `taxdollarcount`

We use kmeans clustering to create new clusters that could helps us better understand the relationships in the data. We used clustering to also create new features:

* Created new clusters using `longitude`, `latitude` and `tax_rate`, as we found that there was a difference in tax_rate, and by using the mean tax_rate of the centroids, we could predict the level of variance in the `logerror`

# Create a new "age_home"

zillow["age_home"] = 2017 - zillow.yearbuilt

# total_property_size (combine calculated square feet of the house plus the size of the lot)

zillow["total_size"] = zillow.finishedsquarefeet12 + zillow.lotsizesquarefeet

# value_ratio = qhat is the rate between home tax and property tax
zillow["value_ratio"] = zillow.landtaxvaluedollarcnt / zillow.taxamount

# What the tax rate is 

zillow["tax_rate"] = zillow.taxamount / zillow.taxvaluedollarcnt

# Modeling
Three different models were implemented:

### Linear Regression
* Using the features identified above, we run a linear regression model. The model performed better than the baseline, but only slightly

* The same model was used, but split by county, so that each county had it's own model. The results were pulled together, and the overall model actually performed about the same as the base line.

* A random forest regressor was also tried, using the same features. Overall, the model performed muched better than the baseline, but had a negative r-square value, meaning that the model was actually performing worse than the baseline. 

## Summary

We gain a lot of useful insight and knowledge in the exploration phase, and clustering allowed us to visualize the data in new and exiting ways. Unfortunately, it is very hard to predict the logerror, as it is fairly close to zero, and in general, the baseline performs about the same as the models. 

We recommend using the baseline, as Zillow has a strong model, with low logerror variance.
